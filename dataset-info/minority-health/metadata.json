    "description": "Poverty: Families/Persons Below Poverty: Families and persons are classified as below poverty if their total family income or unrelated individual income was less than the poverty threshold specified for the applicable family size, age of householder, and number of related children under 18 present. The Census Bureau uses the federal government's official poverty definition. If the total income of a person's family is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the person is considered poor, together with every member of his or her family. If a person is not living with anyone related by birth, marriage, or adoption, then the person's own income is compared with his or her poverty threshold. The poverty thresholds are updated every year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. The poverty thresholds are the same for all parts of the country they are not adjusted for regional, state or local variations in the cost of living. Poverty status is not determined for institutionalized people, people in military group quarters, people in college dormitories, and unrelated individuals under 15 years old. These groups were excluded from the numerator and denominator when calculating the percent of persons below poverty. For more detailed information on this topic, please see the SEER County Attributes web page,the poverty section of the Census Web site or the data.census.gov platform to access data and digital content from the U.S. Census Bureau."
