Dataset Name:
Asthma emergency department visits (adults)
Data Definitions:
Number
Number of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits among NYC adults (18 years and older). ED visits include both patients who are treated and released in the ED (outpatients) and who are admitted as inpatients through the emergency department. An ED visit is included if it has an ICD-9 principal diagnosis code of 493 or an ICD-10 principal diagnosis code of J45. New York hospitals began using the ICD-10 system on October 1, 2015. Because the ICD systems differ in how they classify adult asthma, data are not comparable before and after 2015. Data from 2015 are not shown for adults, because they contain a combination of ICD-9 and ICD-10 principal diagnosis codes.
Estimated annual rate
Number of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits among NYC adults (18 years and older), divided by the population of adults (18 years and older) using NYC DOHMH intercensal estimates; expressed as cases per 10,000 residents. ED visits include both patients who are treated and released in the ED (outpatients) and who are admitted as inpatients through the emergency department. An ED visit is included if it has an ICD-9 principal diagnosis code of 493 or an ICD-10 principal diagnosis code of J45. New York hospitals began using the ICD-10 system on October 1, 2015. Because the ICD systems differ in how they classify adult asthma, data are not comparable before and after 2015. Data from 2015 are not shown for adults, because they contain a combination of ICD-9 and ICD-10 principal diagnosis codes.
Age-adjusted rate
Number of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits among NYC adults (18 years and older), divided by the population in 5 year age groups, using NYC DOHMH intercensal estimates; quotients are multiplied by the proportion of the 2000 US population in each age group. Age-adjusted rate is the sum of the weighted age-specific rates; expressed as cases per 10,000 residents. ED visits include both patients who are treated and released in the ED (outpatients) and who are admitted as inpatients through the emergency department. An ED visit is included if it has an ICD-9 principal diagnosis code of 493 or an ICD-10 principal diagnosis code of J45. New York hospitals began using the ICD-10 system on October 1, 2015. Because the ICD systems differ in how they classify adult asthma, data are not comparable before and after 2015. Data from 2015 are not shown for adults, because they contain a combination of ICD-9 and ICD-10 principal diagnosis codes.
